<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This repository contains software representative of the modeling and simulation work done for my masters thesis while 
studying physics at Virginia Commonwealth University. Ideally you should be very familiar with the original documentation 
for spparks which is available at spparks.sandia.gov.If you would just like to see the software run and are not concerned 
with the details you can skip to the quick start guide.

 The modifications to the SPPARKS source code allow the diffusion application to model up to three different atomic species. 
 In the scripts directory there is an example script to run with SPPARKS. This script will produces images in the data 
 directory that show grain formation of a binary alloy on an arbitrary substrate.
