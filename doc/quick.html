<h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>

<p>SPPARKS is intended to be run on unix type systems. If you are going to follow this quick start guide you must
compile the source code on a unix type system. Else see the "compiling" section for some of the challenges this software
will have for running on Windows.  </p>

<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p> 
Open a terminal and navigate to the src directory. type "make serial" to compile source files into an executable. 
The executable by default has the name "spk_serial". If you see this file in the src directory then you were sucessful 
in compiling. If you are using an IDE be sure to configure the settings of your IDE to use the custom Makefile provided. 
</p>

<h3>Running a Script</h3>
<p> 
 A script can be loaded into the executable using stdin. For example,if you use the script titled "in.spparks" and 
 the executable/script are in the same directory then you can run the program using the command "./spk_serial &lt in.spparks".
 Diagnostics will be displayed in the terminal and snapshots of the alloy state will be dumped in the data directory. 
</p>

<h3>Image Processing</h3>
<p> 
 If you would like to convert these images into a GIF, you can do so easily with ImageMagick which is provided with many unix 
 type systems. The file names have already been padded with zeros so all you should have to do to convert to a movie is
 type the command "convert Image*.ppm foo.gif" while in the data directory. You can also use ImageMagick to convert ppm 
 files to jpeg if need be.
