<h1>Compiling</h1>

<p>
Compiling SPPARKS can be a non-trivial task. Ideally you are using a unix type system. If so then 
the easiest method for compiling is to open a terminal and go to the src directory. Type the command 
"make serial" to generate an executable called "spk_serial" in the same directory. If you see this file then 
you do not need to do anything else.

<h3>Other Target Machines and Porting to Windows</h3>
<p>
Typing "make" will show you all the available targets that you can build with SPPARKS. For this software, we have only used 
the serial target as our machine. The biggest reason is that the serial target works for most cases and 
the deposition command does not allow for parallel processing so there is no reason to build the MPI target. It is possible 
to make an executable in Windows using the Cygwin target but I do not recommend this. SPPARKS takes advantage of functions 
such as popen which is a POSIX standard and not ISO C/C++. There are also concepts like permission bits which make this 
software not easily ported to Windows. If you are still interested in porting I have edited "Makefile.cygwin" so that 
it should produce an executable but be warned that it will create unexpected behavior.
