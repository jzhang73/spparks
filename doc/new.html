<h1>New Functionality and Commands </h1>

<h3>Source Code Changes</h3>
<p>
I have only made changes to app style diffusion. The c/c++ code has been altered to have an additional per site integer array.
This array keeps track of atomic species for each occupied site. All of my edits to the code can mostly be found in the 
app_diffusion.cpp file in the src directory. I have added the comment "marshalltc" where I have made changes. The per site 
array can be accessed via "i2". See the set command in the original spparks documentation to learn more about other per site 
values and accessing them.

 <h3>New Commands </h3>
 <h5><u>Deposition Command</u></h5>
 <p> The deposition command has the following format now.</p>
 <p style="margin-left: 2.5em"> deposition rate dirx diry dirz d0 lo hi n</p>
 <p> You will notice the only difference is that it now takes in an extra integer value n. n specifies the atomic 
 species of atom that you are depositing. The application will keep track of this value and where it might diffuse to 
 by maintaining the i2 array.</p>
 
 <h5><u>Barrier Command</u></h5>
 <p>
 In the beginning stages of my code the per site quantity that specified atomic species did not really affect any calculation.
 As I continued to simulate atoms I adjusted the propensity to take into account the atomic species. Now this code considers
 what type of neighbor atoms an occupied site is coordinated to when calculating the probability of diffusion. It does 
 this by calculating a weighted average of barriers that are specified in a script. The barrier command has been modified 
 to have the following format 
 </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5em">
barrier n Q1 Q2 Q3
 </p>
  <p>
n specifies the type of atom that is potentially diffusing. Q1 is the barrier for atom n in a host crystal of atom 1. 
Q2 is the barrier for atom n in a host crystal of atom 2. Q3 is the barrier for atom n in a host crystal made up of atom 3.
The simulation then takes the weighted average of Q1, Q2, and Q3 based off of the coordination value for each species. So 
for a simulation with three atoms you should use the barrier command three times. To give an example of how this would work 
lets say you have three elements and element 1 is chemically inert and has no interaction with the other two elements. 
This means the barrier for diffusion would be very low or zero when surrounded by elements 2 or 3. The command to specify 
this would be 
 </p>
   <p style="margin-left: 2.5em">
barrier 1 Q1 0 0
 </p>
<p>
With this command, atom 1 will only stick to itself. Likewise we could make the same command for the other two elements. 
 </p>
 
   <p style="margin-left: 2.5em">
barrier 2 0 Q2 0 

 </p> 
   <p style="margin-left: 2.5em">

barrier 3 0 0 Q3
 </p> 
 <p>
 See the barrier command from the original spparks documentation to learn more about how the diffusion barrier and 
 the Boltzmann distribution are used to simulate diffusion events.
