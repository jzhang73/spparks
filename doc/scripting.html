<h1>Scripting</h1>

<p>
SPPARKS is designed to be a complete environment for scripts to run using stdin or standard input. A script will contain 
a sequence of commands to be executed by SPPARKS. The original documentation describes the many commands available and 
will not be covered here. The modifications to the c/c++ source code changes the way two commands work. The deposition 
and the barrier command are new in this program. To see how these have changed see the section new functionality and commands.
An example that uses these new functions is included in the scripts directory.
