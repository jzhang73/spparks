This repository represents the code used for my masters thesis in physics at Virginia Commonwealth University. In the src directory
you will find c/c++ code that is a modified version of SPPARKS (Stochastic Parallel PARticle Kinetic Simulator). The original 
source code for this program can be found here https://spparks.sandia.gov/. You should be familiar with the original 
documentation for SPPARKS because it is not covered here. I have only outlined new functionality and my usage in the manual. In this 
repository there are the following files

README			   this file
LICENSE			   the GNU General Public License (GPL)
doc		           detailed documentation for compiling/running/new commands/etc 
scripts		   	   a script to load into the SPPARKS environment
src			   modified SPPARKS source files
data			   a folder to contain the images created by running the example script
